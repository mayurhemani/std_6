# Science

## Course Overview
The science course designed by advice from giants like Prof. Jayant Narlikar, takes a holistic approach to science education. It covers the following broad topics:
* Understanding stuff you find around you:
  - Food, water, air, garbage (yes!), and the materials making up the stuff.
* Overview of living things:
  - Plants, Animals, And our own body
* Understanding basic physical phenomena:
  - Electricity, Magnetism, Motion, Light
* And one very interesting topic which potentially connects to thermodynamics:
  - "Changes"

## Course Plan

There are possibly many ways to go about covering these topics. This course plan moves along a "local-first" approach. So it covers stuff that we are immediately in contact of first. Sequence of chapters is then:
1. Food, its components (Chapters 1, 2 of the book)
2. Water and its properties (Chapter 14)
3. Air and its properties (Chapter 15)
4. Garbage (Chapter 16)
5. Materials (Chapters 3, 4, 5)
6. Living things - Plants (Chapter 7)
7. Animals (Chapter 9)
8. Our body (Chapter 8)
9. Motion (Chapter 10)
10. Magnets and Electricity (Chapters 13, 12)
11. Light Phenomena (Chapter 11)
12. Changes around us (Chapter 6)

### Testing schedule:
* After topics 1-4, topic 5, topics 6-8, topics 9-10, and after topic 12.
