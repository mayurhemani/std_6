# Computers
The course for Computers is not well defined in the CBSE syllabus. Most schools, however, teach a broad introduction to computers, programming and the Internet. We are going to do that with the following framework.

## Course Overview:
We will divide this course into 4 parts-
1. Understanding the building blocks of a computer.
2. Identify the various ways in which a computer can be programmed. An introduction to software.
3. Actually programming a computer with a simple programming language - Python
4. Doing useful things with a computer

Each of these are further divided into the following topics:

#### Understanding the Computer:
1. The concept of a stored program
2. The basic architecture of a computer in terms of abstract parts
3. Concretizing those abstract parts
4. Identifying the "actions" that a computer can take
5. Abstract assembly language programming
6. Identifying the need for a translator
7. Defining programs and software.

#### Identifying software:
1. Understanding why we need a computer. 10 use-cases.
2. Identifying the software required for each.
3. Identifying with connected computers.
4. Defining a basic programming need which will be the eventual project for this course.
5. Introduction to programming software tools - the editor, the interpreter, and the Linux shell.

#### Basic programming with Python
1. Replicating the assembly language experience.
2. Procedures - introduction to algorithms
3. Types - an introduction to "data"
4. Functions - the bread and butter of python programs
5. Iteration - the bread, butter and jam of programming
6. Fun with the turtle package
7. Concrete python programming project.

#### Doing useful things with Computers
1. Identifying with the need for a website
2. What is a website?
3. Connected computers a revision - server and client
4. Creating a simple Python server with Flask
5. Introduction to HTML
6. Creating static websites with HTML
